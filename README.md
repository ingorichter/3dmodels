## 3D design and models

This repo contains models that I created for fun or profit to fix a broken part or design something from scratch.
These models are sometimes very specific and might not be useful for reuse. I'll put them into this repo to have them backed up and if I need to go back and make changes to existing models.

I use [[https://openscad.org][OpenSCAD]] or [[https://freecad.org][Freecad]] to create the models.
